# Current implementation — A24

**Documented:** pinned Containerlab generic runtime/container interfaces expose inspection and ports, not a dedicated serial-console capability. generic_vm documentation describes a serial Telnet convention separately from shell/SSH; a port or native kind is not proof of a serial console.

**Observed static:** EXP-028 verifies6 pinned source files and12 independent capability-state fixtures. Build/typecheck and5 targeted browser tests pass. The approved node inspector now explains the missing qualified discovery adapter. A23 bounded node logs remain implemented; serial-console discovery and transport remain unimplemented at runtime. No VM was accessed or created.

**Inferred next:** pin and inspect one freely distributable generic_vm/vrnetlab Ubuntu image and its serial backing, establish virtualization feasibility, then qualify a read-only image-specific discovery adapter in a fresh dedicated VM. No image/adapter is yet qualified. Do not promote generic TCP listeners, shell access or documentation hints to available consoles. TT-01, native authority, historical Q outcomes and177 denominator remain unchanged.
