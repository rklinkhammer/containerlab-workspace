# A29 — Phase 4 managed PCAP reanalysis

**Observed:** A28's 1,742 manifest files and predecessor snapshot verified before work; full D-15 archive retained. The link inspector can reanalyze its current managed PCAP with a new display filter or reviewed Lua choice, without recapture. The request supplies only artifact ID/hash, a distinct analysis job ID and reviewed analysis options. The server supplies the retained bytes; identity, original capture metadata, download bytes and five-minute expiry remain unchanged. Cancellation keeps a valid original artifact. Displayed analysis identifies its applied filter and analysis time.

**Observed:** reanalysis runs through a separate fixed worker with no native inventory/capture calls, in the manifest-checked minimal TShark root for both plain and Lua analysis. A shared guest lock and the server's one-job guard serialize capture/analysis. Native malformed-PCAP/hash/path/Lua-ID refusal and lock tests passed. Actual synthetic traffic yielded distinct sequence7/8 frame sets from identical bytes; no-match/invalid-filter, cancellation and expiry-during-analysis (injected clock) checks passed. 85 unit/contract tests, build/typecheck, 19 replay browser tests and two live browser tests passed. Shared Lua sandbox negatives were rerun successfully after helper extraction.

**Observed cleanup:** task lab removed, capture/reanalysis scratch inventory empty, fresh VM `clab-load-20260926-124318-exp016` stopped. No sibling changes or pre-existing VM access. GUI-1 revision 3 structure, TT-01, historical Q statuses and the 177-case denominator remain unchanged.

**Readiness / next:** the selected Linux-veth Phase 4 workflow now includes capture, download, bounded TShark, one reviewed synthetic Lua module and reanalysis. General capture/script coverage remains PARTIAL: no arbitrary Lua, VITA-specific module, additional endpoint profiles or persistent/imported PCAP support. The smallest next step is Phase 5 integrated GUI acceptance for this explicitly supported profile: native loading → enrollment/observation → logs → capture/filter/reanalysis/download → disconnect/recovery. Broader profiles are separately gated and must not be inferred from that acceptance. Serial remains final Phase 6 with a second QEMU-detector four-radio configuration.

See artifacts/design/CAPTURE_CONTRACT.md, artifacts/implementation/A29/RESULTS.md and experiments/EXP-033-reanalysis/README.md (workspace-relative). Ordinary tests/build/preview never create VMs; preview port4173. Live use after cleanup requires another freshly qualified session.

# A28 — Phase 4 reviewed Lua analysis

**Observed:** A27's 1,659 manifest files and predecessor snapshot verified before work. Capture now accepts the reviewed `clab-probe-v1` ID in explicitly qualified sessions. It supplies `clabprobe.version` and `clabprobe.sequence` display-filter fields for a synthetic UDP protocol; this is a qualification fixture, not VITA/radio application policy. Arbitrary Lua paths, uploads and arguments are refused. Results show the reviewed script's ID and SHA-256. Existing capture identity, limits, cancellation, managed download and expiry remain.

**Observed:** reviewed execution uses a minimal manifest-checked TShark root, unprivileged systemd service, private network/devices, restricted address families/capabilities/syscalls, finite scratch, memory, tasks, file size and execution time. Independent synthetic PCAP expectations, private-file/shell/socket-module negatives, integrity rejection, runaway/output limits, actual endpoint capture, empty capture and cancellation passed in a fresh dedicated VM. 83 unit/contract tests, build/typecheck, 17 replay browser tests and 2 live browser tests passed. Two failed sandbox qualification attempts are retained and explained in A28 results. No parser-exploit resistance or universal Lua safety claim.

**Observed cleanup:** the task-owned RUNTIME-PAIR lab was removed, capture scratch inventory was empty, and `clab-load-20260926-122927-exp016` is stopped. No pre-existing VM or sibling workspace was used or modified. Approved GUI-1 revision 3 layout structure remains. Historical Q gates, the 177-case denominator and TT-01 remain unchanged.

**Unresolved / next:** Phase 4 remains partial for saved-capture reanalysis and additional endpoint/script profiles. The smallest next slice is bounded reanalysis of the current managed artifact, with the same identity/expiry and reviewed-script controls. A user's real protocol dissector requires a separate inventory/review and independent acceptance fixtures; this example does not enable arbitrary scripts. Phase 5 integrates supported capabilities; Phase 6 serial remains last, with a second QEMU-detector four-radio configuration.

See artifacts/design/CAPTURE_CONTRACT.md, artifacts/implementation/A28/RESULTS.md and experiments/EXP-032-reviewed-lua/README.md (workspace-relative). Ordinary tests/build/preview do not create VMs; preview uses port 4173. Live capture requires another freshly qualified session after cleanup.

# A27 — Phase4 bounded capture/TShark profile

**Observed:** A26 baseline1569 files verified and D-15 archived. The approved link inspector now starts/cancels exact enrolled Linux-veth captures, supplies BPF/display filters, downloads a managed PCAP and renders allowlisted TShark metadata. One capture,1–10 seconds,1MiB hard output cap,100 analyzed frames,5-minute in-memory artifact expiry. No arbitrary host path, uploads, persistent store, daemon socket in the browser or Lua execution.

**Observed:** fresh Linux RUNTIME-PAIR capture/TShark/hash, invalid BPF, empty capture/invalid analysis, cancellation, injected-clock expiry, byte limit and native same-name replacement refusal tested. One actual browser capture/download test passed.80 unit/contract checks, build/typecheck and16 replay browser checks passed. Failed attempts and one browser timeout are retained. Exact task lab removed; new VM clab-load-20260926-021229-exp016 stopped; capture scratch inventory empty at cleanup.

**Unresolved:** Phase4 is PARTIAL overall: reviewed Lua execution remains gated; other node kinds, reanalysis of stored captures, broader limits, persistent retention and packet-detail decoding are not implemented. Current TShark filter applies to each new capture's first100 frames only. The approved inspector layout structure is retained. No universal capture/losslessness claim or Q-gate promotion. TT-01 and177 denominator unchanged.

Next bounded scope: pin a reviewed Lua dissector and independent synthetic expectations, strengthen/qualify its filesystem/execution sandbox, then allow reviewed IDs (never arbitrary script paths). Broader endpoint profiles and artifact reanalysis remain explicit backlog. Phase5 integrated qualification follows supported Phase4 scope; Phase6 serial discovery/transport remains last with a separate QEMU-detector four-radio variant. See artifacts/design/CAPTURE_CONTRACT.md and artifacts/implementation/A27/RESULTS.md (workspace-relative).

# A26 — Phase3 bounded node-log workflow

**Observed:** verified A25 (1520 manifest files) and archived the complete predecessor/replacement set under D-15. The existing node inspector now provides last25/50/100 fetched-line views, bounded literal case-insensitive filtering, match/empty-state counts and Clear output. Filtering is local after tail selection, never a server command or historical search. Stop retains last-fetched output; Clear cancels follow/read and removes it. Node/session/tab changes reset local view state.

**Observed:** identity conflict and expired/incompatible session errors invalidate workbench enrollment and selection. Transient unavailable/unsupported errors stop follow, clear output, and allow explicit retry. Late responses after cancellation/timeout cannot restore text. Existing native source/identity/disclosure/budgets and node-logs/0.1 transport unchanged.

**Observed verification:**76 unit/contract tests,6 native static/process checks, build/typecheck and14 targeted Chromium checks PASS. Browser transport mocked; native static checks are not new Linux runtime qualification. A23 Linux evidence retains its original scope. No VM operations or sibling edits. Layout structure retained; synthetic desktop/mobile screenshots generated, mobile inspected.

**Inferred next:** Phase4 exact-endpoint capture and managed artifact workflow, then TShark and separately qualified reviewed Lua. Phase5 integrated qualification; Phase6 serial discovery/transport with a second QEMU-detector four-radio configuration after platform qualification. Historical Q outcomes,177 denominator and TT-01 unchanged. See artifacts/design/GUI_CONTINUATION.md and artifacts/implementation/A26/RESULTS.md (workspace-relative). Earlier next directives are historical.

# A25 — GUI continuation Phases 1–2

**Observed:** A24 baseline verified (1472 files, no mismatch), full D-15 predecessor snapshot retained. Current approved-bundle workbench has explicit runtime disconnect, clean reconnect, identity-conflict invalidation, late-response refusal, and repeated/older observation handling. Native load acceptance also checks approved source/bundle identity. A second recorded native graph exposes parallel links and a disconnected node without reusing its historical session.

**Observed verification:** 75 unit/contract tests, typecheck/build and10 targeted Chromium tests passed. Browser evidence is replayed/mocked; no new native/runtime qualification or VM access. Initial browser attempt failed because only one workbench recording existed; retained and corrected with separately pinned historical graph evidence. Approved GUI-1 revision3 layout retained. Existing build chunk-size warning remains.

**Inferred next:** Phase3 log usability/availability audit and remaining bounded log workflow, then Phase4 capture/TShark/reviewed Lua, Phase5 integrated qualification, Phase6 serial discovery then transport using a separately generated QEMU-detector four-radio variant. Neither sibling edits nor VM operations were performed. Do not convert the original fixture or infer console capability from node role.

TT-01, native authority, existing contracts, historical Q outcomes and177 denominator unchanged. Source ingestion remains approved local bundles; arbitrary upload/private source storage and new lifecycle controls are not implemented. See artifacts/design/GUI_CONTINUATION.md and artifacts/implementation/A25/RESULTS.md (paths relative to workspace root). Earlier next-step directives are historical and superseded by this phase order.

# Current implementation — A24

**Documented:** pinned Containerlab generic runtime/container interfaces expose inspection and ports, not a dedicated serial-console capability. generic_vm documentation describes a serial Telnet convention separately from shell/SSH; a port or native kind is not proof of a serial console.

**Observed static:** EXP-028 verifies6 pinned source files and12 independent capability-state fixtures. Build/typecheck and5 targeted browser tests pass. The approved node inspector now explains the missing qualified discovery adapter. A23 bounded node logs remain implemented; serial-console discovery and transport remain unimplemented at runtime. No VM was accessed or created.

**Inferred next:** pin and inspect one freely distributable generic_vm/vrnetlab Ubuntu image and its serial backing, establish virtualization feasibility, then qualify a read-only image-specific discovery adapter in a fresh dedicated VM. No image/adapter is yet qualified. Do not promote generic TCP listeners, shell access or documentation hints to available consoles. TT-01, native authority, historical Q outcomes and177 denominator remain unchanged.
